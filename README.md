# Top-5-European-Football-Teams
###### Football, is a really intense and interesting sport because of the intricacies in playing styles between different nations. Our research and analysis aimed to explore some differences in playing styles as well as other descriptive and performance differences of the top 5 teams from England and Spain from the 2015-2016 season. The teams we chose for our analysis were highly competitive in the year 2015-2016 in both the Premier League and La Liga. The teams consisted of:
#### ● Premier League:
######  ○ Leicester City
######  ○ Tottenham
######  ○ Arsenal 
#### ● La Liga:
######  ○ Real Madrid
######  ○ Barcelona
###### We were interested in better understanding these teams’ success by analyzing past teams performances based on multiple different factors. We will use our knowledge of MySQL and Pyspark to perform multiple statistical analysis. We hoped to uncover descriptive and exploratory statistics about the teams to use them and make inferences about what led to these teams success. We then used the different obtained metrics for our respective teams to compare them together and evaluate their overall performance in comparison to one another. Each team member was appointed a team to focus and run individual statistics on, though all team members used the same dataset. From here, we will use our knowledge of AWS EMR clusters and Hadoop to build a platform that allows us all to connect and test out our analyses.
